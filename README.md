Audio Recording into iOS6 Safari
=====

This hack lets you record audio into a web app on iOS6 Safari. It's very much a hack, but it's as good a hack as any, in that the iOS6 Specification launched in September doesn't allow for audio recording, despite allowing photo and video recording. This implementation takes audio from a video and runs ffmpeg (static Linux build bundled) to extract the audio.you must try this amazing web app.

The file upload example was built using http://www.script-tutorials.com/pure-html5-file-upload/ and the CSS play button was generated from http://cssdeck.com/labs/amazing-play-button-in-css3. The wave waveform is generated in SVG using code from https://github.com/afreiday/php-waveform-svg/edit/master/php-waveform-svg.php.
